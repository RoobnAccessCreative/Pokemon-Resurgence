## Setting Up

  You will need npm installed and to create a react app:  
  
  After that replace the src and public folders with my ones and install a few packages:
  ```
    npm install react-router-dom
    npm install js-cookie
    npm install semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
  ```
  
  Once everything is installed, use 'cd' to get to the folder containing src, public, etc - `cd <folder>`
  Then to run the app, run `npm start`.
