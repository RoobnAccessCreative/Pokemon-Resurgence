## Setting Up

  You will need npm installed and to create a react app:  
  
  After that replace the src and public folders with my ones and install a few packages:
  ```
    npm install react-router-dom
    npm install js-cookie
    npm install semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
  ```
  
  Once everything is installed, use `cd <app/folder>` to get to the folder containing the react app.
  Then to run the app, run `npm start`.
